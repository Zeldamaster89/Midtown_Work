                             My first year working in the summer at midtown was pretty interesting since I was coming out of Highschool and I literally never had 
                            a job and I liked working there since I made some pretty good friends there. I would say one of the things that were the hardest
                            things about working there is the mix of kids and how they act and how you need to quickly adjust to the situation at hand.

                            My second year I think it was smoother working in the summer at midtown because since I already had some experience 
                            working in the summer. Which helped me so much in understanding situations that require a gentle touch. 
                            Like if the student isn't good in a sport and may cry from not being so good than the rest of the team
                            the best way that I did to respond to that situation was to take my time idividually with the student 
                            and work with the student some drills that could help him do better in games. And eventually he got better, 
                            and was very happy to see the results of his hard work.
